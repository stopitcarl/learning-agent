# learning-agent
Artificial Intelligence's second project. An agent must act within a stochastic world and learn. No prior knowledge above said world is given (in the test case the world is a map from the scotland-yard board game but the agent doesn't know). 
The agent implements a Q-learning algorithm with static alpha, gamma and epsilon values.
